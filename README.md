# 16QAM
A Python program to decode a 16QAM signal

Completed as part of CS 314 (Modern Data Communications) at the University of Auckland.


## **Usage:**

The program needs to be provided with a file nibbles.txt which contains a voltage pair on each line e.g. 2.96, -1.38

It converts each nibble to binary and then converts each byte into text which contains the decoded message

The program will also display the decoding process
